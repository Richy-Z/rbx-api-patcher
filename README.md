## ✨ Features

- 🔧 Drop-in clones for common exploit functions
- 🧠 Clean, readable Luau implementations
- ⚙️ Minimal dependencies — just necessary ones
- 📁 Well-structured and easy to extend

## 📦 Included Function Clones

| Function       | Status   |
|----------------|----------|
| `getgc`        | ✅       |
